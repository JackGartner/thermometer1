# Thermometer Project

## This project is being worked on by Ryan Rothermel and Jack Gartner

### Required Arduino Libraries for Operation:

- Disclaimer: some libraries may not be completely necassary

- DHT sensor library (Adafruit)
- DHT sensor library for ESPx (beegee_tokyo)
- DHTlib (Rob Tillaart
- DHTNEW (Rob Tillaart)
- DHTStable (Rob Tillart)
- Grove Temperature and Humidity Sensor (Seeed Studio)
- SDHT (Helder Rodrigues)
- SimpleDHT (Winlin)
- TinyDHT sensor library (Adafruit)
- TroykaDHT (Igor Dementiev)

### This thermometer project is in early stages of development and currently has:
- a working temperature sensor attached to the breadboard and Arduino Uno
- a display of humidity and temperature in Celsius and approximated Farenheit in the serial monitor
- a display of temperature in tens on a 1-digit 7-segment display (ex: 76 degrees F reads as "7")

### We are currently working on:
- displaying the temperature on a single digit screen attached to the breadboard

### Planning on:
- using an LCD screen in the future, but would require a complete overhaul of code, schematics, and wiring
